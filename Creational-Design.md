## Creational Design Patterns
- Design patterns that deal with the creation of an object are called as creational design pattern
## Factory Design Pattern
- Broadly they are categorized into 3 types
    1. Simple Factory Design Patterns
    2. Factory Method Design 
    3. Abstract Factory Design Pattern
## When to think of Factory Design Pattern
- Whenever we are instantiating **Objects** based on some condition then we should think of factory design pattern
## Why to use factory Pattern
- If we dont use factory pattern , then we are violating various solid principles
## Factory Method Pattern
- The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
## Abstract Factory Pattern
- When even we deal about object creation and creating similar type of objects we think about factory design patterns
- Use Case Of Factory Design :
    1. Similar Products
    2. This pattern involves a single method, often called a factory method, which is responsible for creating objects.
## Factory Method vs Abstract Method Pattern
- Factory Method deals with a method which is reponsible for returning the object
- Abstract Factory Pattern : The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
